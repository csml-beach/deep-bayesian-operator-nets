## Description

This directory contains five Jupyter notebook files. Each file contains an implementation for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification of deep neural networks using various architectures. The file [DeepOperator_Neural_Nets.ipynb](./DeepOperator_Neural_Nets.ipynb) contains experimens using our proposed framework. The implementations for Bayesian neural nets, ensemble networks, and mixture density networks are curtousy of [DeepFindr](https://deepfindr.github.io/). For a comparision of the accuracy, and confidence level of differnet methods on a standard dataset please refer to our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10684).
